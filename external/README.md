The external module contains all the integration to other plugins.

## WorldGuard

It adds three flags:
- **create-shop**:
  Whether the player can create shop in the WorldGuard area
- **use-shop**:
  Whether the player can use shop if he is not a member in the WorldGuard area
- **use-admin-shop**:
  Whether the player can use admin shop if he is not a member in the WorldGuard area

You can define the default value of these flags in the configuration.
